Some thoughts:

CherryPy: 
- hosts some big services in areas I'm interested in (Hulu, Netflix, CherryMusic)
- oldest framework

Flask:
- well written docs
- info on security

WebPy:
- Looks like it has a lot of good code samples
- very pythonic - do I even care?

Bottle:
- might be too small? They think so.
