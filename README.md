frameworks_testing
==================

Just sharing code with myself as I test Python web frameworks. Pretty much the most boring repo you could imagine. Move on. Nothing to see here.
In fact, don't even count on the tutorial code to be anything like in the web tutorials, because I take them apart & play with them.

Some thoughts:

CherryPy: 
http://docs.cherrypy.org/en/latest/tutorials.html
- hosts some big services in areas I'm interested in (Hulu, Netflix, CherryMusic)
- oldest framework
- went through and did all the tutorials. They degraded in quality as it went. Something about cherrypy just irritates me.
Flask:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/
- well written docs
- info on security

WebPy:
http://webpy.org/docs/0.3/tutorial
- Looks like it has a lot of good code samples
- very pythonic - do I even care?

Bottle:
http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html
- might be too small? They think so.
